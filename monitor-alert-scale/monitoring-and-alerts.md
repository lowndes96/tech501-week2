# Monitoring 

## dashboard creation code along

* go to monitoring tab within overview of VM 
* can look at metrics, which are running automatically 
* can create a custom dashboard: 
![pin to dash](../25.01.30/pin_to_dash.png)
*image missing? - add again*

## install apache bench: 
* apache bench is a tool to test how well your http server performs, specifically how many requests per second your instalation is able to serve

```
Installing the Apache Bench benchmarking tool on the app VM:
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils

Confirming the installation:

ab

Running a load-test with 1000 requests at a concurrency of 100 requests on my app's IP:

ab -n [flag no. requests] [no. of requests] -c [ flag no.concurent requests] [no. of concurrent requests] [URL of website to perform benchmarking on]
i.e. 
ab -n 1000 -c 100 <publicIP>
```

## tuesday pm solo task 
### instructions: 
```
    Document what was done in the code-along, including... 
        What is worst to best in terms of monitoring and responding to load/traffic. 
        How you setup a dashboard 
        How a combination of load testing and the dashboard helped us 
        Include a screenshot of your dashboard when you manage to get it to stop responding through extreme load testing 
    Create a CPU usage alert for your app instance â†’ you should get a notification sent your email 
        Get the alert to check the average for each minute 
    Document... 
        How to setup CPU usage alert 
        Include a screenshot of the email you received as a notification 
    Post a link to your documentation in the chat around COB 
    In Azure, remove your dashboards and alert and action group 
    Document... 
        How to clean up for this task 

Link to help with Step 2 above: https://www.stephenhackers.co.uk/azure-monitoring-alert-on-virtual-machine-cpu-usage/ 

Hints: 

    You need to set the threshold low enough that the CPU utilization will trigger an alert when you do heavy load testing and you get an email notification 
    During cleanup: After deleting your alert, you will still need to delete your action group 
``` 
--- 
### 
1. start a new vm to monitor 
   * using image created previously, set up and run a vm as usual
2. work out threshold for alerts 
   * if this was a 'real' alert you would want to set the thresholds where the user experience starts to break down 
   * for this example the threshold has been set very low to deliberatly trigger an alert 
3. create a new alert rule 
    scope: 
    ![new alert rule screen](<25.01.04/Screenshot from 2025-02-04 16-27-30.png>)
    (add table of settings in screenshot for clarity)
    
4. create action group (within create alert)
![alt text](<25.01.04/Screenshot from 2025-02-04 16-32-22.png>)
   * click create action group 
   * select email address and add 
   * should recieve the following email: 
   * ![alt text](<25.01.04/Screenshot from 2025-02-04 16-43-10.png>)
   * **note** - action groups cost to run - be sure to delete once not needed
5. trigger the alert 
![alt text](<25.01.04/Screenshot from 2025-02-04 16-48-56.png>)
6. receive alert  
![alert email](alert-email.png)
